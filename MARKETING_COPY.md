## 2. Features Section

**Section Headline:**
Everything you need, nothing you don't

**Section Subheadline:**
Built for teams that want powerful project management without the complexity tax.

### Kanban Boards
Drag-and-drop boards that let you visualize work at a glance. Create columns that match your workflow, move tasks between stages, and keep your entire team aligned on what's happening.

### Priorities & Assignees
Assign tasks to team members and set priorities so nothing falls through the cracks. Filter and sort by what matters — urgent bugs get attention first, backlog items stay organized.

### Multi-Organization Support
Work across multiple organizations from a single account. Each org gets its own workspace with isolated boards, members, and permissions. Switch between them instantly.

### Personal & Team Boards
Keep personal task lists alongside shared team boards. Public boards are visible to your whole org, while private boards stay yours until you're ready to share.

### Open Source & Self-Hostable
Run Naqsh on your own infrastructure. Full access to the source code means you can audit, extend, and customize everything. Your data stays on your servers.

### Role-Based Access Control
Control who can view, edit, and manage boards with granular permissions. Organization admins manage members and settings, while contributors focus on their work.

## 3. Use Cases Section

**Section Headline:**
Built for how you work

**Section Subheadline:**
Whether you're a solo developer or a growing team, Naqsh adapts to your workflow.

### Solo developers
Keep side projects and personal tasks organized without signing up for yet another SaaS tool. Create private boards, track priorities, and move fast. When a project grows into a team effort, your boards are ready to share.

### Small teams
Give your team a shared workspace to coordinate work across multiple boards. Assign tasks, set priorities, and see who's working on what. No per-seat pricing games — add your whole team from day one.

### Self-hosters
Deploy on your own infrastructure and keep complete control over your data. Fork the repo, customize the UI, add integrations, and run it behind your firewall. No vendor lock-in, no surprise pricing changes.

## 4. Open Source Section

**Section Headline:**
Open source, by design

Naqsh is fully open source under a permissive license. Every line of code is available for you to read, audit, and contribute to. No hidden proprietary modules, no open-core traps — the version you self-host is the same one we run.

We believe the tools you rely on daily shouldn't lock you in. Export your data anytime, migrate away if you want, or fork the project and make it yours. Contributions from the community — bug fixes, features, translations — make Naqsh better for everyone.

Self-host on a $5 VPS or on your company's Kubernetes cluster. Naqsh is built with standard open source technologies — Next.js, Prisma, TypeScript — so your team already knows the stack.
